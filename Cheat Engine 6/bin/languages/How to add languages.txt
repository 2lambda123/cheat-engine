create a language folder for your country
copy the .po files to the appropriate folder and then start editing 

Order of picking:
  if there is a cheatengine.po it will pick that, else cheatengine-x86_64.po and if that fails cheatengine-i386.po
  the 32-bit version can work perfectly fine with the 64-bit po


By default it picks the system language, but you can overide this by adding --LANG langstr or -l langstr to the parameters of Cheat Engine
